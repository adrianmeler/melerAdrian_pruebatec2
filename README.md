# Second technical examination

This is my solution to the second technical examination of the Hackaboss bootcamp.
My solution consists of a small administrative application in which users can register new turns. Also, the user can filter the turns by date or they have another option of filtering the turns by date and state.
In the admin zone or page, administrators can see a table with all of the turns that are registered in the system. Administrators can also attend the pending turns and delete a turn of their choice.

## Technologies used for the examination

For this application I used the Java programming language, Jsp, Jpa, a MySql database for saving the turns, I used Bootstrap, Html 5 and Css.

### Supuesto

In the administrator zone the administrators should be able to use a login so that they are the only ones who can edit and delete the turns, but in this case the application can only be used by administrators so the 
login was not necessary. Also for simplicity's sake.
